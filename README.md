## OpenRouter AI Integration

The chatbot uses OpenRouter to provide intelligent, role-specific responses:

### Configuration

1. **Get an OpenRouter API key**:
   - Sign up at [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
   - Generate an API key from your dashboard

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file in the project root
   VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Fallback Mode**:
   - If no API key is configured, the chatbot will use smart fallback responses
   - Perfect for development and testing without API costs

### Features

- **Role-specific prompts**: Different system prompts for high school vs university students
- **Hong Kong context**: Tailored advice for Hong Kong's education and job market
- **Smart fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- **Cost-effective**: Uses GPT-4o Mini model for optimal performance/cost ratio

### Customization

You can customize the AI behavior by modifying:
- `src/services/openRouterService.ts` - System prompts and model configuration
- Model selection (currently using `openai/gpt-4o-mini`)
- Response parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
